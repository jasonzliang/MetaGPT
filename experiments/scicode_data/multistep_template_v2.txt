PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with previous problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PREVIOUS PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

{problem_steps_str}

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

{next_step_str}

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

{dependencies}

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
2. Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
3. Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
4. You are highly encouraged to import and call helper functions from PREVIOUS PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE to help implement the solution code.
5. DO NOT include EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response and make sure your solution is in format of ```python```.
6. VERY IMPORTANT: The function name in your solution must match the name in the function header.

Example:
```python
[Insert the Python code here based on the provided function header and dependencies.]
```
