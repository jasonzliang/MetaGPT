    Write a python function that can {instruction}.

    The function should follow Google's Python Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and be modular, easy to read and maintain. The function should return the result of the operation in a clear and understandable way.

    Here is an example of how your function might look like:

    ```python
    def my_function(parameter):
        """This is a one-line description of what this function does.

        Args:
            parameter: This is the explanation of the parameter.

        Returns:
            The return value and its explanation.

        Raises:
            Any exceptions that are raised and why they might occur.
        """
        # Your code here
    ```

    Please replace `my_function`, `parameter`, `This is a one-line description of what this function does.`, `This is the explanation of the parameter.`, `The return value and its explanation.`, `Any exceptions that are raised and why they might occur.` with your actual function name, parameters, descriptions, return values, and exception handling respectively.
