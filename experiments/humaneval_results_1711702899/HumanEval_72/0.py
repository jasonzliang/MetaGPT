    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

        q: A list of integers representing the weights of an object.
        w: An integer representing the maximum possible weight that the object can carry.

    Returns:
        True if the object will fly, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If q is not a list or if any element in q is not an integer.
        ValueError: If w is not a positive integer.
